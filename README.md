# Pattern Analysis
Pattern Analysis of various datasets by COMP3710 students at the University of Queensland.

We create pattern recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow (TF), PyTorch or JAX.

This library is created and maintained by The University of Queensland [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) students.

The library includes the following implemented in Tensorflow:
* fractals 
* recognition problems

In the recognition folder, you will find the OASIS brain segmentation used by StyleGAN2 to produce realistic fake images.

*please refer to StyleGAN2-OASIS_45711110 for the better model. v2:1 channel - grayscale uses single channel as MRI scans are grayscale but the observed result was poor so wasn't persued further.
